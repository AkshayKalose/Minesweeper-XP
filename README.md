## FAQ

### How do I perform chording?
Chording is supported for both mouse and trackpad. With a mouse, you can chord by either **clicking both the left and right buttons** or by **middle clicking the scroll wheel**. With a trackpad, you can chord by holding down at least one of these additional keyboard buttons while left clicking: **Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Meta (Cmd for macOS, Win for Windows)**.

#### What is chording?
Chording is a feature in Minesweeper which allows you to open up all adjacent unopened tiles relative to an open tile with the number *n*, only if there are also at least *n* adjacent flags. (Basically, with chording, you can flag the unsafe tiles with bombs, and open all the adjacent safe tiles in one click.)
